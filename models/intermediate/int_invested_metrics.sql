    Calculates each investor's percentage of total equity contributions
    using window functions for accurate portfolio-level percentages.
    
    Migration Notes:
    - Migrated from root level to intermediate layer
    - Updated reference: hkh_dev.tbl_terms â†’ direct table reference
    - Preserved exact business logic for equity percentage calculations
    - Maintained COALESCE logic for handling personal loans
    - Verified all required columns exist in stg_terms
